.emacs.d
==========

caution
--------
This repo is useful for me, but I don't know about you, too.
Some missing elisps may be installed when launch emacs by el-get.
If you don't have el-get, my elisps will install el-get with other elisps.
So, It will take minites first init using this .emacs.d.

When you notice something bad, let me know it!

You should installed cvs, svn, git, hg, bzr before using this repository because elisps install through by el-get.
